 To achieve the script to put the tickers in a new column and to get total volume of a ticker i used the in credit card in class activity to help generate my code. To acheive the data in the summary table is also used the credit card activity code as a guide to the tickers, yearly change and percent change.

To acheive the greatest increase,decrease and total volume I used the worksheet.functionsmax/min which I found on the microsoft learn/help website for vba. To get the tickers to match the numbers I used the match worksheetfunction which I learned about from a tutoring session. To help me further undersatnd the function i again use the microsoft help/learn website. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.max,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.Min, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.match
