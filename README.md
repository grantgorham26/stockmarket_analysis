# stockmarket_analysis
In this project I used vba scripting to analyze stock market data. The script created iterates through rows. When iterating through the rows, the script is able to grab opening stock values, closing stock values, volume of a stock and the stocks ticker symbol. The script is able to calculate the total volume of a specific stock, the yearly change of a specific stock in terms of raw number and a percentage. The script is also able to find the stock that has the max total volume in a specific year. Its also able to find the stock that has the greatest % increase and greatest % decrease in a specific year.  


 To achieve the script to put the tickers in a new column and to get total volume of a ticker i used the in credit card in class activity to help generate my code. To acheive the data in the summary table is also used the credit card activity code as a guide to the tickers, yearly change and percent change. To do the conditional formatting portion I used the grade check condtionals as a resource for how to write that code. 

To acheive the greatest increase,decrease and total volume I used the worksheet.functionsmax/min which I found on the microsoft learn/help website for vba. To get the tickers to match the numbers I used the match worksheetfunction which I learned about from a tutoring session. To help me further understand the function i again use the microsoft help/learn website. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.max,https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.Min, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.worksheetfunction.match

To get the code to run on all workshets I used the student census part 1 in class activity as a resource.
